Hello! I'm Cheng Guo, currently a junior undergraduate student at the [Antai College of Economics and Management](https://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/en/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I major in Economics and minor in Big Data Management and Applications.

For my research interests, Iâ€™m extremely interested in applying optimization models involving stochastic control to solve real-world problems and in the field of machine learning algorithms.

You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV_Cheng_Guo.pdf).
